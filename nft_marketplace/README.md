# ðŸ›’ NFT Marketplace (Native Solana Program)

A full-featured NFT Marketplace built natively on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com/) without using the Anchor framework. This program demonstrates how to implement a robust NFT marketplace with direct CPI calls, manual account validation, and secure PDA usage. Great for developers who want to learn low-level Solana development practices while supporting core marketplace functionalities.
